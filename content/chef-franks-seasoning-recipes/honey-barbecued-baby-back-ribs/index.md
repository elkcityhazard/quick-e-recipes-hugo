Chef Frank&#8217;s Honey Barbecued Baby Back Ribs are so delicious and easy to prepare in the oven or on the barbecue grill. Great with <a href="/wordpress/recipes-for-special-occasions-and-events/roasted-red-potatoes-recipe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">roasted red potatoes</a> and <a href="/wordpress/vegetables-and-salad-recipes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">salad</a> or fruit. 

## Honey Barbecue Baby Back Ribs Ingredients

  * 3 lb or more baby back pork ribs
  * 1/2 onion, cut chunky
  * 1/2 tsp Chef Frank&#8217;s Seasoning
  * pinch white pepper
  * 1 c honey barbecue sauce
  * 1 c barbecue sauce (if you prefer regular barbecue sauce without honey)
  * 1/2 c water

## Honey Barbecue Baby Back Ribs Directions

In roasting pan, place ribs, water, onion, and seasoning. Cover and roast at 300* for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from oven and brush sauce over ribs (you may have to drain excess liquid first). Place under broiler to finish or outside on the barbecue grill.

**Note:** can be enjoyed with <a href="/wordpress/chef-franks-seasoning-recipes/scalloped-potatoes-grandmas-comfort-food/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scalloped potatoes</a> in winter, and <a href="/wordpress/vegetables-and-salad-recipes/potato-salad-recipe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">potato</a> or <a href="/wordpress/vegetables-and-salad-recipes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vegetable salad</a> in summer. I suggest fresh sweet corn in season!
