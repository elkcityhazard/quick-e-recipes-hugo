Delicious lime chicken, southwest style, made from cut up chicken or boneless breasts. Fresh lime and zest with [Chef Frank&#8217;s Seasoning][1], puts it over the top!

## Lime Chicken Ingredients

  * 1 chicken cut in 1/8&#8217;s or ( 8 chicken breasts) boneless skinless
  * 4 limes or 4 tbsp lime juice
  * 1 tsp Chef Frank&#8217;s Seasoning
  * 1 tsp southwest or tex mex seasoning
  * 1 tsp paprika
  * 2 tbsp melted butter
  * 1 lime for lime zest (peel skin and slice very thin, place over chicken before cooking)

### Lime Chicken Directions

#### Baking Method

Place chicken in baking dish. Brush with butter, season, squeeze limes over chicken, bake uncovered 375* 35 -45 for whole chicken. For breasts only, bake for 20 -25 minutes or until tender and juice runs clear.

#### Barbecue grill method

Same as above for seasoning, place on grill. For whole chicken pieces, cook on grill until thoroughly cooked. You can also par boil chicken first, then season to place on grill, to cook faster. You can use a food thermometer, it should be at least 165* internal temperature. Same for breasts.

Goes great with [Spanish rice][2] and any [vegetable][3] or [fruit salad][4].
