Roast chicken is a quick recipe for a nice supper. All of our [side dish recipes][1] are compatible, and hot rolls with butter tops it off.

## Roasted Chicken For 4

  * 1 whole chicken (rinsed)
  * 1 tsp Chef Frank&#8217;s Seasoning
  * 1 tsp sage (rubbed)
  * black pepper to taste
  * 1 tsp garlic (granulated or fresh chopped)
  * 3 tbsp butter (melted)

### Roasted Chicken Directions

Place chicken breast side up in roaster pan. Brush with melted butter then season. Roast in oven uncovered at 325* for 1 1/2 hours.

**Note:** This recipe is good with [mashed potatoes][2], [gravy][3], [stuffing][4], and any side dish. I love [macaroni and cheese!][5]
