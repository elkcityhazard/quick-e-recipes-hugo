Let&#8217;s have broiled whitefish from Lake Michigan. Simply place on foil pie pan, butter, season, and broil. Serve with drawn butter or tartar sauce. Serve with any side dish, salad, rice, or potato.

## Broiled Whitefish Ingredients

  * 1 disposable. pie tin 9&#8243;-10&#8243;
  * 2 fresh whitefish (preferred from Lake Michigan)
  * 2oz. butter melted
  * couple shakes of Chef Frank&#8217;s Seasoning
  * 1/2 lemon
  * 2 oz. water

### Broiled Whitefish Directions

Place whitefish in pan, then add water (do not spray pan as skin will come off when cooked). Brush with butter, then add Chef Frank&#8217;s Seasoning to taste, and squeezed lemon. Place under broiler about 1/2 way to bottom. Broil for about 5 minutes. As soon as the fish flakes, it&#8217;s done. Serve with [drawn butter][1], or [tartar sauce][2].
