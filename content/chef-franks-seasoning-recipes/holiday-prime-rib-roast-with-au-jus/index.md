## Prime Rib Roast Ingredients

  * 15-19 lb rib roast
  * 1/4 c garlic, fresh chopped
  * 1 tbsp Chef Frank&#8217;s Seasoning
  * 2 c water

### Prime Rib Directions

Place rib roast in large roasting pan, bone down, add water and seasonings. Cover and place in oven at 275* and roast for 5 hours then check with thermometer. When it reads 140&#8457;, it&#8217;s rare, 150&#8457; is med. rare, and 160&#8457; is medium. Remove from oven, debone, and slice to appropriate sizes. Serve with Au Jus.

**Note:** Wonderful Christmas entree. Serve with [Twice Baked Potatoes][4], [scalloped corn][5] and [salad][6]. Any side dish will work.

**To De-bone:** When roast is done cut along sides of rib bones and lift individual ribs from roast. Then trim along top of rib just under the flat bone and lift off. Then slice to desired thickness.

### Au Jus Ingredients

  * 4 c water
  * 4 tsp beef base ( paste or boullion)
  * 1 c red wine
  * 1/2 onion (remove before serving)
  * 1 tsp garlic, chopped
  * 1/4 tsp white pepper

### Au Jus Directions

In sauce pan place water, beef base, garlic, white pepper, and wine. Simmer for at least an hour. May simmer for hours and adding small amounts of water from evaporation.

**Note:** Best when made from drippings from your roasts. Just pour into sauce pan and add seasonings and wine, simmer and serve.
