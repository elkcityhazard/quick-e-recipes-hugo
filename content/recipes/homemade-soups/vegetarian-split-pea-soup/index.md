  * 1 lb dried split peas
  * 1 onion, diced

  * 3 tbsp vegetable base (boullion)
  * 8 c water
  * 1/2 tsp white pepper

## Directions

In large soup kettle, place all ingredients except peas. Bring to boil then add peas. Place in crockpot or continue to Boil on medium heat for about 2 1/2 hours or until peas are incorporated and soup is thick. Watch carefully near the end so soup doesn&#8217;t stick to kettle as it thickens. Serve with [salads][1], crackers, [sandwiches][2], or [fresh bread][3]
