## Jamie&#8217;s Mothership Tomato Salad

_Recipe from Jamie O._

## Ingredients

  * 2 1/4 lbs mixed ripe tomatoes, different shapes and colors
  * sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
  * a good pinch of dried oregano
  * Red wine or balsamic vinegar
  * extra virgin olive oil
  * 1 clove garlic, peeled, grated
  * 1 fresh red chili, deseeded and chopped

## Directions

Depending on the size of your tomatoes, slice some in half and some in quarters and others into uneven chunks. Put the tomatoes into a collander and season with a good pinch of sea salt. Give them a toss, season again and give a couple more tosses. The salt won&#8217;t be drawn into the tomatoes; instead it will draw any excess moisture out, concentrating all the lovely flavors. Leave the tomatoes in the collander on top of a bowl and let stand for about 15 minutes, then discard any juice that has come out of them.

Transfer the tomatoes to a large bowl and sprinkle over the oregano. Make a dressing using one part vinegar to three parts oil, the garlic, and chill. Drizzle the tomatoes with enough dressing to coat everything nicely.
