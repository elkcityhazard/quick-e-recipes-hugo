Quick Easy Bacon Wrapped Steak Recipe is a great Appetizer for parties. Bacon Wrapped Steak dipped in Seafood Sauce is nice on your New Year&#8217;s Eve Party.

## Bacon Wrapped Steak

### serves 15

  * 2 lb steak, cut in 1&#8243; squares
  * 1 lb bacon, cut strips in 1/2
  * toothpicks
  * deep frying kettle with oil

## Bacon Wrapped Steak Directions

Wrap bacon around steak and secure with a toothpick. Deep fry at 350* for 3-5 minutes or until desired doneness is achieved. Serve with a hot cheese dip, or seafood sauce.

**Note:** My daughter introduced this party snack to me on [New Years Eve][1] several years ago. Even though I love this snack we joke because of its lack of healthiness and call it Fat Back. Enjoy!
