Quick Easy Macaroni and Cheese Recipe is made from Cheddar Cheese, Milk, and Butter, like Mom used to make. Macaroni and Cheese for Lunch or Dinner is a Winner that [Kids][1] and Adults Love.

## Macaroni and Cheese Ingredients

**Serves 8-12**

  * 2 lb macaroni
  * 2 lb shredded cheddar cheese (sharp)
  * 1 1/2 c milk
  * 2 oz. butter melted or soft
  * salt and pepper to taste

## Macaroni and Cheese Directions

Boil macaroni for 8 minutes, drain. Add most of the cheese (hold back some for the topping), milk, butter, and seasoning. Mix well . Put the rest of the cheese on top. Bake 350&#8457; for 45 min. to 1 hour

**Note:** I have friends that like diced onion in their macaroni and cheese. I like adding ground beef sometimes. Ham is also used, or bacon. You could add tomatoes and green peppers and have goulash. Isn&#8217;t this fun?
