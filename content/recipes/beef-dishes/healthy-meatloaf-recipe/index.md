Quick Easy Meatloaf Recipe from Mom&#8217;s Cupboard is made from Fresh Ground Beef, Onions, Celery, Eggs, Bread, and Spices. Meatloaf also makes Good Leftovers for [Sandwiches][1] or just re-heat and eat.

## Meatloaf Ingredients

**serves4-6**

  * 2 lb. ground beef
  * 3 eggs
  * 1/2 onion diced
  * 1 rib celery cut into small pieces.
  * 1 c ketchup
  * 1/2 tsp garlic, (chopped or granulated)
  * 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs
  * 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
  * pepper to taste
  * season salt to taste, or1/2 tsp
  * 1/2 c water

## Directions

In a large mixing bowl, soak the bread in the water, then add everything but the ground beef and mix well. Then add the ground beef and mix well. In a baking dish place meatloaf mixture and press firmly getting most of the air out, form a loaf or, lay flat in pan then using film wrap press a valley down the middle of the loaf. You can put more ketchup on the top too if you wish. Bake at 350&#8457; for 1 hour.

### Serving Ideas

In the winter months I like to make [mashed potatoes][3] and [gravy][4] with meatloaf. A nice [green salad][5] with lots of vegetables, and [warm biscuits][6].

In the summer take this recipe and form football shaped individual servings and fire up the grill. Cook them like you would a burger. Great with fresh sweet corn, sliced garden tomatoes, and cucumber slices. This sounds really good as I gaze at the ginormous snowbank out my window.
