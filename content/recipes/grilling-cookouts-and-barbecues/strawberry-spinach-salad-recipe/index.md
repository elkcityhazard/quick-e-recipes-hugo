Quick Easy Strawberry Spinach Salad Recipe is a Wonderful Summer Salad with Pine Nuts, Blueberries, Strawberries, Fresh Spinach and Strawberry Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing.

While visiting friends, we were pleasantly surprised when they served this salad, espescially knowing they grow their own fruit.

## Strawberry Spinach Ingredients

**Salad serves 4-6**

  * 1 lb fresh baby spinach
  * 1 pint fresh strawberries
  * 1/2 c pine nuts
  * 1/2 c fresh blueberries
  * 1/2 c balsamic vinaigrette
  * 1/2 c cooked chopped bacon(optoinal)
  * 1/2 c crumbled feta
  * eggs, boiled, peeled

## Directions

Rinse spinach, let dry and place in large salad bowl. Rinse and top off Half of the strawberries, cut in pieces and put on spinach along with pine nuts, feta, and blueberries. Add bacon if desired.

### Dressing

Take 1/2 of fresh strawberries(rinsed and topped), and put in food processor. Chop until smooth with a few chunks remaining and Mix with vinaigrette. Pour desired amount of vinaigrette over salad and serve.

**Chef note:** Try deep frying a fresh flour tortilla (for a taco salad type bowl) by using a ladle and pressing the middle of the tortilla gently down into a deep fat fryer 350* and forming a bowl as it fries. Keep a pair of tongs handy to remove tortilla from the fryer. It only takes a couple minutes at most for each one. Load it with salad when it cools and its a wonderful colorful, delicious salad.
