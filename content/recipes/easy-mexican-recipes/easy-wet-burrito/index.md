Quick Mexican Wet Burrito is excellent for Lunch or Supper, and adds an Ethnic Flare to any everyday Mexican Meal.

## Wet Burrito Ingredients

**Serves 8**

  * 8- 12&#8243; soft tortillas
  * 3 lb ground or shredded beef
  * 1 pkg taco seasoning
  * 1 diced onion
  * 2 diced green peppers
  * 1 head lettuce, shredded
  * 4 tomatoes diced
  * 2 lbs refried beans
  * 1 c black olives
  * 2 c [salsa][1] (chunky)
  * 2 c shredded cheddar (any cheese you prefer works)
  * 1 c sour cream
  * 1 c sliced jalapenos

## Wet Burrito Directions

Brown ground beef, drain, then add taco seasoning.  
Lay out tortilla. Put ground beef, refried beans, some onion and green pepper, and cheese. Make sure you have room to wrap them up. Once burrito is folded, top with refried beans a little salsa and cheese. Bake 375&#8457; for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and top off with your choice of toppings.

**Note:** I like to ask my guests or kids what they like inside their burrito, some people like lettuce inside, or black olives etc. Anything goes!
