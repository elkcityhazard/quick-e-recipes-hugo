Michigan applesauce is wonderful for this Pork loin with dijon and a little Marsala wine marinade. Break out the [barbecue grill][1] because summer grilling is recommended.

## Applesauce Dijon Pork Loin Chops Ingredients

  * 6-8# pork loin (cut into 1/2&#8243; chops or leave whole)

### Marinade

  * 2 c. applesauce
  * 1/4 c. dijon mustard
  * 1/4 c. brown sugar
  * 8 oz. apple juice
  * 2 tsp soy sauce
  * 4 oz. marsala wine

### Pork Chops

Mix marinade together well. Place pork into a large roasting pan for marinading. Pour marinade over pork and let stand for a couple hours or overnight. Remove pork and place on hot bbq grill. Brown on each side and add more marinade while grilling. May also be done in 350&#8457; oven for about 20-30 minutes.

### Whole Pork Loin

Cut valley down middle of pork loin and fill with marinade along with brushing outside of loin as well. after marinading for several hours, place on grill covered and turn every ten minutes or so, continue to add more marinade. after pork juice runs clear, middle should be cooked.
