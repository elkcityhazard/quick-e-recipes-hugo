  * 2 ribs celery, diced small
  * 2 tbs yellow mustard
  * 1 c ketchup
  * 2 tbs brown sugar

## Sloppy Joe Directions

In a skillet or elect. fry pan, brown ground beef, onion, and celery, chopping up ground beef as it cooks. When cooked and celery is tender, drain grease from ground beef. Then add remainder of ingredients and simmer slowly, stirring frequently. Once mixture is fully heated, it is ready to serve or place in a crockpot to hold. Serve on fresh hamburger buns or kaisers.

**Note:** This same recipe can be used with ground turkey (which I recommend using the rosemary), chicken, or shredded pork.
