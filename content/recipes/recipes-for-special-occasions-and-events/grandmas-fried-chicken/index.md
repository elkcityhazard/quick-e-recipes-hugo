I remember being at my grandmother&#8217;s house on any Sunday and smelling the aroma from her awesome cooking. Grandmas chicken that she pan fried, then placed in a slow oven. She always had scalloped corn, mashed potatoes and gravy ( made from the chicken pan), Rolls, relish tray, and three layer jello with cream cheese in the middle for dessert. I love to create similar memories for my family. I thank my grandmother for taking the time to show me some of her methods.
