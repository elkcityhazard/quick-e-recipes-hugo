## Shrimp Curry Recipe Ingredients

**serves 8**

  * 3 lbs shrimp (raw 21-25 per lb. peeled deveined, remove tail)
  * 1 onion large cut
  * 1 green pepper large cut
  * 1 lb fresh pea pods
  * 1 lb bean sprouts
  * 2 ribs celery angle cut
  * 1 lb fresh sliced mushrooms
  * 1/2 c flour
  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  * 2 tbsp curry powder( or red paste if you like it hotter)

## Shrimp Curry Recipe Directions

In large bowl, place shrimp flour and curry. Mix it up. In large frying pan, high heat, put olive oil (wait for pan to heat up a little). When olive oil starts to smoke, put in enough vegetables as not to crowd (to cause water to form in pan) and stir fry (frying at 450&#8457;) moving food constantly. When vegetables change color slightly they are done (about 5 minutes). When all vegetables are cooked then cook shrimp in the same pan. It&#8217;s probably all sticky but when the shrimp are in the pan, put a touch of water in to lift the flavor off the pan. When shrimp is pinkish, it&#8217;s done. Mix with vegetables and serve.

**Note:** can be served with fettuccine and fried cabbage and onion. Also good with wild rice or couscous. (I&#8217;m getting hungry just thinking about it).
