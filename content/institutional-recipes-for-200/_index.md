Welcome to our institutional section. Here we will be providing recipes for large groups around 200. We chose this number as it is easy to divide into 1/2&#8217;s for 100 or quarters for 50. If a larger number is needed, it&#8217;s easy to multiply as well. We are offering the easiest method to prepare recipes from main entrees to desserts and everything in between. Most all of the recipes to date on our site will be converted to institutional recipes so large groups can enjoy the best of foods. All the recipes can be used for weddings, parties, church functions, school lunch kitchens, etc. If you ever have any questions about cooking for large groups just contact us at <cheffrank@quick-e-recipes.com> We will put our 39+ years of experience to work for you.
