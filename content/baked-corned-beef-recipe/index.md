Roasted Corned Beef Recipe is Quick and Easy with a [spicy mustard][1] and honey seasoning. Roasted Corned Beef is a great Fall recipe and goes well with [red potatoes][2] and cabbage.

## Baked Corned Beef Ingredients (with Honey Mustard Optional)

**serves 10-14**

  * 3-5 lb corned beef brisket (raw, usually contains season packet)
  * 1 c dijon mustard
  * 1/4 c honey
  * 1 tsp garlic, granulated or fresh chopped (in jars at your grocers)
  * 1/8 tsp white pepper
  * 1/2 c apple juice

## Baked Corned Beef Directions

Using a roaster, pour in apple juice. Then put in the corned beef brisket. In small mixing bowl mix honey and dijon together, then spread on brisket. Add garlic and white pepper on top. Bake covered 325&#8457; for 3-4 hours or until tender. You may uncover and put under broiler for about 5 min. or until glazed brown.

**Note:** when doing any roasts, patience is the magic wand. I like doing roasts on days when I&#8217;m home with little to do(except play in the kitchen).

Some serving ideas for corned beef are roasted cabbage and carrots, saurkraut, red potatoes, [squash][3]. Any of these can be roasted with the corned beef with the right size roaster.
