## Irish Steak and Dark Beer Pie

**serves 6**

  * 2 pkg pie crust (or crust for two 9&#8243; pies)
  * 3 lbs sirloin steak, cut in 2&#8243; long thin strips
  * 3-4 bottles dark beer
  * 1 bunch scallions (green onions) chopped
  * 1 lb sliced fresh mushrooms 
  * 1/2 red onion sliced or diced
  * 4 large red potatoes thinly sliced
  * 4 carrots, peeled sliced thin
  * 1 tsp beef base
  * 2 or more tbs roux

## Directions

### For The Pie

Place thinly sliced steak in frying pan to brown on high heat, (be careful not to put too much in or it could get watery). Once meat is browned, place in roasting pan with beer, onions, scallions, mushrooms, potatoes, and carrots and put in 325&#8457; oven for two hours covered. Strain liquid into pan, and after boiling slowly add <a href="/wordpress/easy-vegetarian-dinner-recipes/how-to-make-roux/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">roux</a> and whisk until smooth. Add beef base to taste while boiling slowly and whisking.

### For The Crust

Cover the bottom of a 13&#215;19 baking pan with pie crust reserving two crusts for top. Pour in drained beef and vegetables and smooth out in pan. Pour enough gravy evenly over top and cover with the pie crust. Place pie into 400&#8457; oven for 30 minutes or until crust is lightly brown.

**Tip:**

Have a shiny crust by brushing on [Egg Wash][1] before going in the oven. Serve this wonderful Irish meal with a [Green Salad][2] and [Irish Fluff][3] for dessert.
