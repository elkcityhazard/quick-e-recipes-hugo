## Honey Barbecue Country Ribs Ingredients

  * 3 lb country pork ribs

  * 1 to 2 c honey barbecue sauce
  * 1/2 c water

## Honey Barbecue Country Ribs Directions

In roasting pan, place ribs, water, onion, and seasoning. Cover and roast at 275* for 2 -1/2 hours. Remove from oven and brush sauce over ribs (you may have to drain excess liquid first). Place under broiler to finish or outside grill.

**Note:** can be enjoyed with _<a href="/wordpress/chef-franks-seasoning-recipes/scalloped-potatoes-grandmas-comfort-food/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scalloped potatoes</a>_ in winter, and _<a href="/wordpress/vegetables-and-salad-recipes/potato-salad-recipe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">potato</a>_ or _<a href="/wordpress/vegetables-and-salad-recipes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vegetable salad</a>_ in summer. I suggest fresh sweet corn in season!
