## Angie&#8217;s Crescent Turkey Casserole

**4 servings**

_Recipe from Angie G._

**Prep/total time 30 min.**

  * 1/2 c mayonnaise (canola)
  * 2 tbs all-purpose flour
  * 1 tsp chicken boullion
  * 1/8 tsp pepper
  * 3/4 c milk (1%)
  * 1 1/2 c cubed cooked turkey breast ( or chicken)
  * 1 pkg ( 10 oz.) frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
  * 1 tube (4 oz.) refrigerated crescent rolls (reduced fat)

## Directions

In a large saucepan, combine the mayonnaise, flour, boullion, and pepper. Gradually add milk; stir until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Add turkey and vegetables; cook 3-4 minutes longer, stirring occasionally. Spoon the mixture into a greased 8&#8243; square baking dish.

Unroll crescent dough and seperate into two rectangles. Seal seams and perforations. Place over turkey mixture. Bake at 375* for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.

**Note:** The Italicized items are what I use. I love to put chicken breasts in the crockpot while I am at work and come home and prepare a double batch of this in a 9&#215;13 baking dish. My family requests this recipe often and is a great find!
