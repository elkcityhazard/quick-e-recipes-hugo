            Traditional Gypsy Stew Joe Grey is a traditional Gypsy stew often made with sausage and bacon but can be modified to fit whatever flavor profile, or ingredients in your refrigerator, that you might desire.
Joe Grey History A popular dish in the Romany community, no one is sure of its origins. This recipe takes its inspiration from the wondering nature of the people who created it. It has a superb umami flavor due to the combination of meats and tomatoes.

            Having a hard time getting the onion smell off your hands? Try running your hands in cool water for a few seconds, then grasp the neck of the faucet and slide you hands quickly back and forth on the chrome causing some friction. Rinse and Voila! No smell.

            I was thinking about crowding the other day as I sat on bleachers in the gym waiting to hear our grandson sing for his class Christmas concert. It was uncomfortable and hot, with little room to relax your arms or stretch your legs. It was all worth it when our grandson was on stage singing and shyly smiling as he noticed us in the audience. After the concert I started thinking about food crowding and how it challenges the quality of a recipe.

            <h3><a href="https://quick-e-recipes.com/demo/why-i-became-a-cook/"> Why I Became A Cook</a></h3>
            I remember as a small child of 4or5 years old sitting in front of our black and white TV. On the screen was a lady pouring in a powdery substance, then adding a liquid. She started stirring the mixture up and all of a sudden it was something totally different, a doughy mound. ” Wow”, I thought, ” I wish I could do that”. I can’t explain why I was so mesmerized by something so simple, but I knew I wanted to what that lady did on TV.

            Grilled sandwiches have one thing in common, both pieces of bread are buttered on the outside for grilling. Usually on a flat griddle or frying pan. Use medium heat, and don’t be in a hurry or the out side of the sandwich will be dark, but cold in the middle. If you make a grilled sandwich that uses ham, it’s a good idea to heat the ham enough to remove the water, usually 1 minute in the microwave will do it.

            I remember being at my grandmother’s house on any Sunday and smelling the aroma from her awesome cooking. Grandmas chicken that she pan fried, then placed in a slow oven. She always had scalloped corn, mashed potatoes and gravy ( made from the chicken pan), Rolls, relish tray, and three layer jello with cream cheese in the middle for dessert. I love to create similar memories for my family. I thank my grandmother for taking the time to show me some of her methods.

            Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and it gets your metabolism going. A good thing to do first thing in the morning is to drink an 8 oz glass of water with two tablespoons of lemon juice added. This will help kick start your metabolism. Then, have a protein rich breakfast that includes 20 grams of carbs from fruits or whole grains.
