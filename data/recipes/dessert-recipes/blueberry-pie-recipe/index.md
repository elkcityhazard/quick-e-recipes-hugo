Quick Easy Blueberry Pie Recipe is made from fresh or frozen blueberries, (preferrably from <a href="https://www.buchansblueberryhill.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Buchan&#8217;s Blueberries</a> in Traverse City, Michigan out on the Old Mission Penninsula), sugar, lemon juice, and quick tapioca for thickening. Blueberry Pie is a nice dessert for any occasion.

## Quick Blueberry Pie Ingredients

  * 1 pkg. pie crust (2-9&#8243;)
  * 4 c blueberries (Buchan&#8217;s Blueberries are the best!)
  * 3/4 c sugar
  * 1 tsp lemon juice
  * 3 tbsp quick tapioca
  * 1/8 tsp salt
  * 1 tsp vanilla ext.

## Blueberry Pie Directions

Press crust in 9&#8243; pie pan. In large mixing bowl, combine ingredients and mix well. Pour into pie shell and even out. Place top crust over pie and crimp. Bake at 350&#8457; for 50-60 minutes.

### Crimping

Taking finger and thumb fold both top and bottom crust curling it as you rotate around pie, thus sealing in the filling. Then crimp edges, pressing your thumb into top edge while thumb and forefinger support the bottom and press, then repeat around the pie.

**Note:** you can shine up your crusts with an [egg wash][1] by combining 1 egg and 1 oz. water, mix well and brush over raw crust. Bake as usual.
