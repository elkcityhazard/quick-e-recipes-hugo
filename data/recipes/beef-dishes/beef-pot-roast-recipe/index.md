Beef Pot Roast for a Delicious Supper is a Quick Easy Recipe with [Potatoes][1] and Carrots, and only takes 15 Minutes to Prepare, then place in Oven to Roast. Sunday we&#8217;re having Pot Roast!

## Pot Roast of Beef (English cut or Chuck) Ingredients

**serves 8**

  * 3-4 lb roast
  * 1 onion cut in chunks
  * 8 potatoes peeled, cut in half
  * 8 carrots peeled, cut in 1/4&#8217;s
  * 1 tsp ground rosemary
  * 1/8 tsp white pepper
  * 1 tsp garlic (granulated or fresh)
  * 2 c water

## Directions

Place water and roast in roasting pan. Add vegetables and seasonings. (Avoid salt until roast is done as salt will draw moisture from meat).

Cover roasting pan and roast at 275&#8457; for 3-4 hours. Reserve juice from roast to make gravy if desired.

For a different taste, try adding 1 can beer to the pot roast instead of water before roasting, I think you&#8217;ll like it.
