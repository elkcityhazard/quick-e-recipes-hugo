Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and it gets your metabolism going. A good thing to do first thing in the morning is to drink an 8 oz glass of water with two tablespoons of lemon juice added. This will help kick start your metabolism. Then, have a protein rich breakfast that includes 20 grams of carbs from fruits or whole grains.
