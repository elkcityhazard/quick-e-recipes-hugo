Our homemade biscuits are a light and fluffy [quick bread recipe][1]. Less than 10 minutes to prepare, and in the oven for about ten minutes. These biscuits go excellent with strawberry short cake, [sausage gravy][2], stews, and topped with [honey butter][3].

## Biscuits Ingredients

  * 2 c flour
  * 2 1/2 tsp baking powder
  * 1/2 tsp baking soda
  * 1 tsp salt
  * 1/3 c veg. shortening
  * 3/4 c milk or buttermilk (if you don&#8217;t have buttermilk, just add 1 tsp vineager to milk before mixing).

### Biscuits Directions

Mix dry ingredients together. Cut in shortening until incorporated. Add milk and mix until dough forms. Do not over mix. Place dough on floured surface and roll out with rolling pin so dough is about 1/2&#8243; thick. Cut biscuits using a cutter or a cup or glass. Place biscuits on greased sheet pan. Bake in preheated oven 425* for 7-10 minutes.  
Makes about a dozen biscuits.

Also try these delicious biscuits with [beef][4] or [chicken][5] stew or with some [Chef Frank&#8217;s Cherry Honey][6] on top.
