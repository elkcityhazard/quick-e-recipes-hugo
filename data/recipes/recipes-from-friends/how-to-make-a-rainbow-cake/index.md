Once your kids have one, they want one forever!

Recipe from Angie M.

Use one box of white cake mix, follow directions on box.  
Split the batter into 6 equal parts using cereal bowls.  
Color and mix together each bowl as follows:

  1. Red
  2. Orange
  3. Yellow
  4. Green
  5. Blue
  6. Purple 

If you use 2 round tins, do as follows:

**Please note:** The batter layers need to bake firm to hold the next batter layer, (do not over cook).

### Tin One

  1. Red batter, bake 10-15 min. Then add
  2. Orange batter, bake 10-15 min. Ten add
  3. Yellow batter, bake until done ( 10-15 min.)

### Tin Two

  1. green batter, bake 10-15 min. Then add
  2. Blue batter, bake 10-15 min. Then add
  3. Purple batter, bake until done (10-15 min.)

Tin two is the bottom cake layer, and tin one is the top.

**Note:** If you use a 9&#215;11 cake pan, the directions are the same except you reverse the color order when adding and baking colored batter layers.

Frost with any frosting recipe.
