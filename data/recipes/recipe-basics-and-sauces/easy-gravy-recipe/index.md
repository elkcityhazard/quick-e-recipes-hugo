## Gravy Recipe Ingredients

_This is a variable for beef, chicken or pork gravy._

  * 1 tbsp Beef, chicken, seafood, or pork base / boullion (usually 1 tsp per cup of water)
  * 3 c water
  * 1/2 c roux

## Directions

Boil water with base. Thicken slowly with roux to desired thickness using wire whisk. Serve.

**Note:** with chicken, or turkey gravy, you can add a little oregano and sage. Pork gravy like whites pepper and sage. Beef gravy likes garlic, oregano and if making swiss steak, tomatoes cut up in the gravy is delicious. It is also good to use drippings from meats to make gravy when possible, and add a little base to help with flavor.
