## Traditional Gypsy Stew

Joe Grey is a traditional Gypsy stew often made with sausage and bacon but can be modified to fit whatever flavor profile, or ingredients in your refrigerator, that you might desire. 

## Joe Grey History

A popular dish in the Romany community, no one is sure of its origins. This recipe takes its inspiration from the wondering nature of the people who created it. It has a superb umami flavor due to the combination of meats and tomatoes. This makes it a beautiful fall addition to lift your spirits as the weather gets colder.  
The Romany people have their origins in India. Their cuisine borrows from other European countries. Paprika, garlic, bell peppers, and potatoes are a common staple in the Romany cuisine. In some ways, I assert Joe Grey to be simple and enduring much like a Hungarian Goulash. This is a loose comparison. It will remind you of Sunday Gravy as a child growing up.
