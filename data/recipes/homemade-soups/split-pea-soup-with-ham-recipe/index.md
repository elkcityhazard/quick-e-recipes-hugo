Quick Easy Split Pea Soup Recipe to warm up any cold day. Our split pea soup recipe has fresh carrots, onion, celery, potatoes, and ham, slow cooked for perfection. Break out the crackers.

## Split Pea Soup with Ham Ingredients

**Serves 10+**

  * 1 lb dried split peas
  * 1 onion, diced
  * 3 ribs celery, diced
  * 2-3 potatoes, peeled, diced
  * 3 carrots, peeled, diced
  * 3 tbsp chicken base
  * 3 quarts water
  * 1/2 tsp white pepper
  * 1 ham bone (with 1 lb ham)

## Split Pea Soup Directions

In large soup kettle, place all ingredients except peas. Bring to boil then add peas. Boil on medium heat for about 2 1/2 hours or until peas are incorporated and soup is thick. Watch carefully near the end so soup doesn&#8217;t stick to kettle as it thickens.
